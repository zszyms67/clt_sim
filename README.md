# clt_sim
Simple simulation of Central Limit Theorem. 

Can use data generated from a uniform, beta, exponential, or normal distribution. 
Will result in sampling statistics and a histogram of sampling distribution. 

This was a university assignment and only serves as an educational tool (mostly for myself).
